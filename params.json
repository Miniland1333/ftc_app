{"name":"FTC Team 6286","tagline":"Android Studio Development for the 2015-2016 FTC Competition","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis page is the landing and launch platform for CBHS Robotics code development. \r\n\r\n### The New Platform\r\nFor the 2015-2016 competition season, FTC requires that all teams integrate ZTE Smartphones to replace the older NXT based system. This allows us to use Android Studio along with Git and GitHub in order to generate code while keeping all members updated. Android Studio uses Java code, which is a change from Robot C. \r\nApp Inventor is a scratch-like interface that does not allow for GitHub collaboration, but is great for helping to arrange code visually and programming complex tasks.\r\n\r\n### About Us\r\nWe are a fourth-year FTC Robotics team. We started in 2012 with Ring-It-Up and have progressively grown from there. Our team size ranges throughout the season, usually with a high of 40 and a condensed size of 15. We welcome all grade levels and hope to provide the opportunity to many to learn about real-world engineering and software development.\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors  \r\nTeam Coordinator  \r\n--Henry Agnew (@Miniland1333)  \r\nProgrammers  \r\n--Colin Campbell ()  \r\n--James Casey ()  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
